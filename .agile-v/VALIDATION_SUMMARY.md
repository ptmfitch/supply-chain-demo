## REQ-0136 — Fix B (merge not replace) + hydration-unsafe date fallback (2026-07-27, prior draft)

**Trigger:** User-reported recurring badge-revert + Sentry `STOCK-INVENTORY-3` Hydration Error on `/orders/[id]` (prod, 27 events/6 users, regressed).

**Scope:**
- `lib/react-query/ssr-sync-policy.ts` — added `"applyDensifyOnly"` action + `mergeSsrIntoCache`/`mergeDensifyOnly`. The already-shipped `bf6d9f6` fix (Fix A) stops trusting differing SSR badges while a mutation is invalidated/fetching. This adds Fix B: even the remaining "apply" paths now **merge** onto cached (gap-fill densify fields; overlay-merge for proven-fresher/empty-cache cases) instead of a blind `setQueryData(serverData)` full replace, so a thinner/differently-shaped SSR snapshot can never silently drop or clobber an already-patched field.
- `hooks/use-sync-ssr-query-data.ts` — consumes the new action.
- `lib/date/format-stable.ts` (+ `lib/format` barrel) — new `toDateOrNull`. Replaced the `order?.createdAt ? new Date(...) : new Date()` anti-pattern (fallback to "now" differs between SSR render time and client hydration time — a textbook hydration-mismatch source) across all 7 detail pages: Order (store + admin), Invoice, Product, Category, Supplier, Warehouse. Also gated 3 previously **ungated** `ClientRelativeTime`/`ClientDateTime` renders (Category/Supplier/Warehouse header + Warehouse "Created" row rendered unconditionally, not behind `dataLoading`) — the more likely reproducible mismatch source than the already-`dataLoading`-gated Order page.
- Verified Cursor's already-committed Top Products `groupBy(productId)` + collapse-duplicates fix (dashboard-data.ts / AdminAnalyticsContent.tsx) — correct, no changes needed.
- No debug instrumentation found in working tree (already clean before this session's edits).

**Gates:** lint ✓ · tsc ✓ · test 746/746 ✓ (+8 new merge-helper tests) · invalidate 221/221 ✓ · build ✓

**Evidence summary**

```
Scope: built/verified | Traceability: REQ-0136 | Findings: PASS
Decision Points: kept Fix A (bf6d9f6) as-is; added Fix B as pure-additive safety net (no resolveSsrSyncAction test regressions); hydration fix is defense-in-depth — could not conclusively prove it is the exact STOCK-INVENTORY-3 trigger without Sentry's Diff Viewer HTML, but it is the only concrete non-determinism source found in that render tree and the 3 ungated pages are a stronger repro candidate
Log: 2026-07-27 | build-agent | REQ-0136 Fix B + hydration harden | REQ-0136, REQ-0009
```

**Not committed/pushed** — holding for explicit go-ahead since the prior push (`bf6d9f6`) started the Gate-2 Sentry 24h watch; another deploy now would restart that clock.

## REQ-0136 — Gate-2 cache smoke §10 A1/A2/B1 (2026-07-27)

**Scope:** No code changes — live browser verification only (dev server + demo catalog seed, admin role). AC1–2 (UI mismatch pass) previously closed via REQ-0141–0187 child REQs.

**Method:** `npm run script:reset-demo-db -- --with-catalog` → `npm run dev` → Playwright browser session logged in as `test@admin.com`.

| Check | Action | 0s | ~5 min / nav-away+back | Result |
|-------|--------|----|-------------------------|--------|
| A1 | Edit product "Beats"→"Beats Pro", qty 50→55 (catalog) | List/detail/category/supplier grids all show Beats Pro, 35 avail, 20 reserved | Same values held after 5 min background wait + `/` → back navigation | PASS |
| A2 | List → click product (Link nav) → detail → Back | — | Back returned to list showing "Beats Pro" 35/20 reserved, not stale "Beats" 30 | PASS |
| B1 | Invoice INV-DEMO-002 Sent/$100-of-$3980 → Edit → Status Paid, Amount Paid 3980 | Invoice detail: Paid, $0.00 due; Order ORD-DEMO-002 paymentStatus instantly "Paid" (order-graph patch) | Same after 5 min + nav away/back — no revert to Sent/partial | PASS |

Warehouse/product reserved qty (20) correctly unchanged by B1 — order stays `Confirmed` (not `Delivered`), so disjoint-reservation stock stays held per REQ-0103; this is expected, not a bug.

**Gates:** lint ✓ · test 738/738 ✓ · invalidate 221/221 ✓ · build ✓ (no code changes)

**Evidence summary**

```
Scope: validated | Traceability: REQ-0136 (AC3–6) | Findings: PASS (3/3 smoke checks)
Decision Points: no code changes needed; disjoint-reservation "no release on paid" behavior confirmed correct per REQ-0103, not a regression
Log: 2026-07-27 | red-team-verifier | REQ-0136 §10 A1/A2/B1 cache smoke PASS | REQ-0136
```

**Remaining before Gate 2:** Sentry 24h watch (REQ-0009) — human-observed, cannot be automated from this session.

### VS-045 — Admin network audit (REQ-0117, read-only)

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Cold list API (`orders`, `products`) | 1.0–2.0 s                                                                | Expected — MongoDB + Redis miss on Vercel                          |
| `session` / `jwe`                    | 20–290 ms                                                                | Expected                                                           |
| High total requests (~292–453)       | Warm prefetch + TanStack warm + RSC                                      | Expected aggregate — **no duplicate API call proven**              |
| Admin My Activity hooks              | `useOrders`/`useProducts`/… + SSR `initial*` + `useSyncSsrQueryDataMany` | OK — `withInitialData` / `refetchOnMount:false` pattern (REQ-0021) |

**Recommendation:** Defer prefetch reduction unless HAR shows same endpoint twice on single page mount (confirmed VS-046).

### VS-046 — Production network confirm (REQ-0118)

**Verdict: OK for production** — timings are acceptable for this architecture; not a bug.

## REQ-0121 — UI/data-sync bug sweep (2026-07-15)

**Repro method:** Live browser QA against `npm run dev` (Redis + Mongo dev instances) using `reset-demo-db` → admin login → created category/warehouse/product (Sony TV, SK34, qty 50, $50) → allocated 20 to Main Warehouse → created 20-unit order (auto-assign) → edited product qty 50→20.

**P0 finding:** Every reproduction path (same-page mutation, cross-page nav via Link, browser back-button to a pre-mutation-cached page, dialog reopen) showed correct fresh data at HEAD `efb2e88` (post-REQ-0120). No repro. Found and fixed one adjacent real defect: `WarehouseDetailPage.tsx` `allocationRows` fallback ternary would keep showing frozen SSR `initialStockAllocations` whenever the live query resolved to `[]` (e.g. last allocation deleted) — changed to `stockAllocations ?? initialStockAllocations ?? []`.

**P1–P12 findings:** Visually confirmed via live browser (zoomed screenshots) before fixing: date-field placeholder near-invisible in dark dialog (P2), supplier dropdown item text white-on-white in light popover (P3), order-line subtotal showing fee-adjusted total instead of plain line amount at qty 120 (P6), order fee tier producing total > subtotal on a $1000 test order (P7 — server totals confirmed client-only computation, no server duplicate to sync). Remaining items (P1, P4, P5, P8–P12) fixed from code-level analysis matching existing sibling patterns (Category dropdown readability, `OrderPickerCommand`'s existing `rounded-md`, other FAB dialogs' `onOpenChange`).

**Build-time catch:** First `next build` after AC9/AC10 failed TypeScript check — `SemanticBadgeProps.size` is `"compact" | "detail"`, not `"sm"`; fixed across 4 files, gate re-run clean.

**Gates:** lint ✓ · test 504/504 ✓ · invalidate 208/208 ✓ · build ✓ (all re-verified after the size-prop fix, HEAD `efb2e88` + uncommitted REQ-0121 changes).

**Not yet committed** — 15 files changed, pending user go-ahead to commit/push.
